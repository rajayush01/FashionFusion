# Marmeto_assessment

This project is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays a page where the user can toggle among three different tabs: Men, Women, and Kids. Clicking these tabs shows the respective product cards and hides the others. Each product card contains the product image, title, vendor name, price, and discount. I have integrated an API for all the product details. All the details of the product cards, including the product image, come from API responses, and the discount percentage is calculated using JavaScript.
